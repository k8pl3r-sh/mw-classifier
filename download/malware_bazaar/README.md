### Start the docker

```bash
docker build -t download_samples .
docker run --name download_samples -v <mount_point>:/app/temp -d download_samples
# Replace the actual <mount_point> by a real one
```

### How does it work ?

Bash script execute hourly at XX:30 to download the latest samples from Malware Bazaar and store them in the mounted volume.
Zipped samples are generated roughly every hour by Malware Bazaar.

### WIP

- [ ] Optimize the Dockerfile to be memory  and running time efficient (check `docker ps -s`)
- [ ] Optimize the logging part by using journalctl
