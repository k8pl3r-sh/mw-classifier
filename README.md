 Machine Learning research on malware detection and attribution

#### Goals

The goal is to build a machine-learning module to be used to classify malwares according to their features and to attribute them to a specific threat actor.
To do so, we'll use this repository as a part of a bigger project, using Karton tool from CERT-PL to deploy a vast architecture of malware analysis tools.

- [ ] Create a dataset of malware samples to be used for training and testing
- [ ] Implement a machine learning model to classify malware samples
- [ ] Implement a machine learning model to attribute malware samples to a specific threat actor
